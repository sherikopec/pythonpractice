## TASK 1
​
# given a 5x5 grid, add the last column and row, then flip the card at the
# coordinate specified by the user
​
five_by_five_grid = [
    ['X','0','X','X','X'],
    ['X','X','0','0','0'],
    ['X','0','X','0','X'],
    ['0','X','X','X','X'],
    ['X','0','0','X','X'],
]
​
# first step is to add colum 6 and row 6
​
# output the grid to the user
# ask the user for the coordinate of the card to flip
# e.g. input could be: (0,2)
​
# output the grid with the flipped card
​
## TASK 2

# given a six by six grid, work out what card was flipped
​
# your program should output the coordinate of the flipped card
# in this case it would be: (x,y)
